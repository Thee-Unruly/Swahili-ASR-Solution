---

## Challenge Overview

This project aims to develop an **offline, edge-device optimized Kiswahili Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model** capable of serving over 200 million speakers across East and Central Africa.

**Key Constraints:**
* **Single NVIDIA T4 GPU** (≤16 GB RAM)
* **Real-time inference capability**
* **Offline operation** (no cloud dependency)
* **Open-source data and tools only**
* **Bonus Target:** <4GB memory footprint for mobile deployment

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Base Model Selection

* **Primary Approach:** Fine-tuned **Whisper-small** (244M parameters) for its proven multilingual capability and efficient architecture.
* **Alternative:** **Wav2Vec2-base + CTC decoder** for potentially greater efficiency on edge devices.

### 2. Dataset Strategy

* **Primary Dataset:** **Mozilla Common Voice Swahili** (100+ hours of labeled speech from native speakers).
* **Data Augmentation:**
    * Speed perturbation (0.9x, 1.0x, 1.1x)
    * Noise addition (SNR: 10-20 dB)
    * SpecAugment
    * Time stretching
    * Pitch shifting (±2 semitones)
* **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Audio normalization to 16kHz mono
    * Voice Activity Detection (VAD) for trimming
    * Text normalization for Kiswahili orthography
    * Handling code-switching (Swahili-English)

### 3. Model Optimization for Edge Deployment

* **Quantization Strategy:**
    * Post-training quantization (INT8)
    * Dynamic quantization for inference
    * Knowledge distillation from a larger model
* **Pruning Approach:**
    * Magnitude-based pruning (30-50% sparsity)
    * Structured pruning for hardware efficiency
    * Gradual pruning during fine-tuning
* **Model Compression:**
    * ONNX Runtime optimization
    * TensorRT conversion for GPU inference
    * Mobile-specific optimizations (NNAPI, Core ML)

### 4. Training Strategy

* **Phase 1: Transfer Learning**
    * Fine-tune pre-trained Whisper on Common Voice
    * Learning rate: 1e-5 with cosine annealing
    * Batch size: 16-32 (memory dependent)
    * Mixed precision training (FP16)
* **Phase 2: Domain Adaptation**
    * Fine-tune on target domain data
    * Curriculum learning: clean $\rightarrow$ noisy data
    * Multi-task learning with language modeling
* **Loss Functions:**
    * CTC Loss
    * Attention-based cross-entropy
    * Knowledge distillation loss (if applicable)

### 5. Real-Time Optimization

* **Streaming Architecture:**
    * Sliding window approach (25ms frames)
    * Context window: 3-5 seconds
    * Overlap-and-add for continuity
    * Voice Activity Detection integration
* **Memory Optimization:**
    * Gradient checkpointing
    * Dynamic batching
    * KV-cache optimization for decoder
    * Memory-mapped model loading

### 6. Language Model Integration (Bonus)

* **Pawa-min-alpha Integration:**
    * Use as a rescoring model
    * N-best list reranking
    * Contextual language understanding
    * English response generation pipeline
